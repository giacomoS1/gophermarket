Should have a limit to the length of the name, price, and description
We'll have a limited number of suggested locations, so we'll just use numbers to designate location to save space. (0 = Coffman, 1 = Territorial, 2 = Pio... etc)
Because we want to be able to upload several pictures, we'll want to link to a folder of images. To figure out which image will be the cover, just use the first alphabetically for now.
